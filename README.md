## Configuration

### Environment Variables
You can customize the script behavior by setting the following environment variables:
- `NETWORK_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to the network configuration files.
- `LOG_FILE_PATH`: Path to save the log files.

Example:
```bash
export NETWORK_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config
